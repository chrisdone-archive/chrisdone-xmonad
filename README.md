My panel is written in Haskell using Webkit and GTK+ for the window and the display, with XMonad handling the layout properly.

The panel displays things of interest to myself:

* Disk usage.
* Battery life.
* CPU temperature.
* Load.
* Volume.
* Real (non-cache) memory usage.
* My currently clocked in hours of work (of total 8:00).
* How many keys I've pressed today.
* The current time in my time zone (CET/CEST) and the time in PST and EST time zones.
